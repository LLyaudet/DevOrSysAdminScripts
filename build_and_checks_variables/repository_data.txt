Look at grep_variable to understand the structure of this file.
Basically, it has almost no structure apart from some lines
starting with a "variable_name=".
Anything else is comments.

Why one venv for each Python dependency ?
Because no language of my knowledge did it right to handle all
possible dependency conflicts.
So in case of such a conflict, one specialized venv can get you out
of any problem.
The best solution would have been to allow install of different
versions of the same package, and have a mechanism:
- first intent, use the latest available version of a package among
those that satisfy the declared dependency constraints of the package
that has this dependency;
- second intent, check a dependency overload configuration file
with tree structure: if calling python package is A version 1.1.1
with dependency B itself with dependency C, use B 2.2.2 and C 3.3.3;
you could have along that another rule saying that when called
directly B 2.2.2 should use C 4.4.4;
and even more complicated:
if calling python package is A version 1.1.1 with dependency B and D
both themselves with dependency C, use B 2.2.2, D 0.1.0,
and C 3.3.3 for B, and C 4.4.4 for D;
once you've seen that it can never be more complicated than that once
the same version number guarantees that the code is the same,
you create a config language "à la CSS" for cascading dependencies ;)
XD fit into JSON the dumbest possible way and you stop bothering
about dependency conflicts for the rest of history of informatics.

Wonderful someone rediscovered nested structures XD
Seriously so many engineers or computer scientists are dumb to cry.
