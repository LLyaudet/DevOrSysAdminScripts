<p>Currently, the biggest part of this repository is in a suite of shell
scripts about build and checks that I use in some of my other
repositories.</p>
<p>I tried to follow some conventions for my bash code:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to encapsulate most of the code in functions.</li>
<li>Unless used as return values, variables in functions are defined as
local variables (<code>local</code> keyword or <code>declare</code>)
with prefix “LFBFL_”.</li>
<li>When used as return values, variables in functions are defined as
global variables (<code>declare -g</code>) with prefix “<span
class="citation" data-cites="function_name">@function_name</span><span
class="citation" data-cites="_result_">@_result_</span>”.</li>
<li>Whenever a variable is no more modified after some point, add the
keyword <code>readonly</code> or use <code>declare -r</code>.</li>
<li>Whenever a variable will only contain integer values (or boolean
values as 0 or 1), use <code>declare -i</code>.</li>
<li>I named bash files with suffixes “.exec.sh” when the script can be
runned (executable, abbreviation stops before a vowel).</li>
<li>I named bash files with suffixes “.libr.sh” when the script contains
only functions definitions (library, abbreviation stops before a
vowel).</li>
<li>When some “.exec.sh” code is encapsulated into functions, either
these functions can be reused and go in some “.libr.sh” file, either
they are truly specific to this script and they are kept in “.exec.sh”
file.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the files “pre-commit” and “post-commit” were not renamed, since
it is not possible to give them other names to use them as
pre-commit/post-commit hooks in <code>git</code>.</p>
